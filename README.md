## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod changes the Spellhold Dungeon to make it more fun and challenging for veteran BG2 players. It includes three components that can be installed together or separately.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

>Although it is not required for the Improved Alysum mod to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-impasylum.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **impasylum** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-impasylum --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components.<br /><br />

**0. Detectable Spells** (Required for the other components)<br />

This component is required in order for the others to function correctly.

By default, Baldur’s Gate II’s AI engine is remarkably simple. This component changes all of that. Detectable Spells does not include any game play per se, nor does it include anything that players are going to notice in the game. What it does do is enhances the AI capabilities of Baldur’s Gate II. This is necessary for the other components in the mod to function correctly. The other components in the mod as well as the harder fights and improved combat AI will not work if you do not install this component.

This is the same Detectable Spells enhancement that is found in many other combat-enhancing mods so if you have one of those installed then this may not be necessary. Please install it if you are not sure. There will not be any problems if you do.

## 

**1. Improved Asylum Mod for BG2:ToB**<br />

This is the primary component of the mod. It will modify the asylum dungeon itself and installs new features including increased number of encounters, improved fight scripts, new items, and other miscellaneous tweaks. Most notable among these are:

- Resting in the Asylum is made more difficult by random difficult enemies given a 50% chance to appear on rest.
- There is a party of adventurers in the previously empty room in the Asylum. You can get some basic information about Spellhold from them. You may also choose to fight them. WARNING: This is easily the most difficult fight in the game, and probably tougher than anything you've ever seen before. This fight is totally optional even if the mod is installed. If you do manage to win, though, they do have pretty awesome loot (although it has been significantly toned down from earlier versions of the mod).
- The Umber Hulk prison is somewhat more challenging.
- The face riddles are replaced, giving some new riddles.

## 

**2. Spellhold Lich**<br />

This is exactly the same as the Spellhold Lich mod that I've been supporting for several years now. The two are compatible, so if you have a previous version of Spellhold Lich, you won't be fighting two liches at once. This will add a lich to the library in Spellhold, right before you meet the vampire. I've been told that it's of moderate difficulty, but a fun fight.

Installing this component and the previous one (Improved Asylum) will result in your having to fight against two liches at once. If you do not want that, then leave this component uninstalled. You will still have the fight against the lone lich that is included with Improved Asylum.

## 

**3. Improved Player Scripts**<br />

Let's face it, the original scripts that Bioware made for the game seem more akin to BG1 scripts than for the greater powers of BG2. They do not use high level spells, waste spells on weak opponents, etc, nor do they include intelligent casting. This component allows you to select a new script for any of your mage or cleric NPCs. These scripts concentrate on defense and healing first, then focus on offense. They will use high level spells and will not waste spells on unworthy opponents (No Horrid Wiltings on a lone goblin, for example).
